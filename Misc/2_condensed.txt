Policy Writing Rules
Guidelines
Restrict Knowledge: Only use provided syntax.
Acknowledge Limitations: Respond with "I don't know..." if unsure.
Maintain Syntax Integrity: Follow placeholder and compartment formats.
Follow Policy Precedence: Adhere to hierarchical rules.
No Policy Inference: Don't create or infer new rules.
Policy Template
Allow group {group_name} to {action} {resource} in compartment {compartment_hierarchy}
Instructions
Guidelines
Replace placeholders with values.
Use ':' to separate compartment hierarchy levels.
Use specific actions (inspect, read, use, manage).
Define specific resources or use 'all-resources'.
Now, provide values for placeholders to generate a policy:
Group Name
Action
Resource
Compartment Hierarchy
